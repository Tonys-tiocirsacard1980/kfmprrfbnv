Just walked out of seeing that Snow White movie, and man, my head's still buzzing from all the glittery nonsense and slightly cringey moments. Why, oh WHY, did the dwarves have to sing like that? Do they have secret opera lessons somewhere in the forest? Because, quite honestly, if I had a ruby for every time they belted out a tune, I could open up a new branch of my jewelry shop. 

Honestly, though, it was... charming? In that slightly annoying, stuck-in-your-teeth way, like caramel popcorn when you accidentally eat it too hot. It burns, and you know it’s a bad idea, but the taste kind of makes it okay. Snow White’s voice was a bit too chirpy, like she swallowed a canary or something, but I guess that's the whole fairest of them all shtick. 

The forest! Goodness, I felt itchy just looking at all those leaves and creatures popping out, like they threw a bunch of glitter into a hurricane. But then again, that’s what makes it magical, isn't it? You know, the kind of magic where you’re not sure if you've accidentally taken someone else’s glasses during a jewelry fitting and now everything's just a tad mysterious.

> I am still trying to figure out if the Evil Queen's mirror had a hotline to therapy or if it was just really, really full of itself. Talking mirrors, the Yelp for self-esteem crises. Who signed up for that job anyway? Probably someone who couldn't handle the crowds at a diamond sale, sniffing out imperfections and relishing every shiny flaw.

Why do they always portray the prince like he's just returned from a lengthy spa day? Not a single hair out of place, which, let's face it, is impossible unless you've been frozen in carbonite since 1983. Honestly, though, I'd download the movie just to watch that perfectly blue-eyed stare again. Or maybe it's just my tired eyes playing tricks on me. Who knows?

```csharp
string[] dwarfs = { Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, Bashful, Sneezy, Doc };
foreach (string dwarf in dwarfs) {
    Console.WriteLine(dwarf +  sings!);
}
```

Anyway, if you've got an evening free and want to hyper-observe the chosen hue of red on Snow White’s lips (jealous of that perfect tone, honestly), then watch the movie. Just be prepared for some serious suspension of disbelief. Maybe more like drop disbelief from a cliff and hope it lands in a safety net made of sparkles and childhood memories.

Now, off to scrub the lingering symphony of dwarves from my brain while imagining what a diamond-studded castle would look like. Spoiler: It’s blindingly fabulous.
